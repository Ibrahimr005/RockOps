# Deployment Verification Guide

## üö® **CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEPS**

This guide ensures the enhanced warehouse-equipment transaction system works correctly while maintaining **100% compatibility** with existing warehouse-warehouse transactions.

## üìã **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

### 1. **Code Compilation Verification**
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: All code compiles successfully (mvn compile completed)
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: No compilation errors in new enhanced transaction system
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Existing warehouse-warehouse code remains untouched

### 2. **Database Migration Ready**
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Migration file `V2__Create_enhanced_equipment_transaction_tables.sql` created
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Migration only adds new tables (transaction_history, consumable_movements)
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: No changes to existing transaction tables

## üß™ **Step-by-Step Verification Process**

### **STEP 1: Deploy Database Migration**

```sql
-- Execute this migration script
-- File: backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__Create_enhanced_equipment_transaction_tables.sql

-- This will create:
-- 1. transaction_history table
-- 2. consumable_movements table  
-- 3. Views for analytics
-- 4. Integrity validation functions
```

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ New tables created, existing tables unchanged

### **STEP 2: Start Enhanced Application**

```bash
# Start the application with enhanced services
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Application starts successfully with new enhanced services loaded

### **STEP 3: Verify Warehouse-Warehouse Transactions (UNCHANGED)**

**CRITICAL TEST - Warehouse-Warehouse Transaction Still Works:**

```bash
# Test existing warehouse-to-warehouse endpoint (UNCHANGED)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transactions/create" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_JWT_TOKEN]" \
  -d '{
    "senderType": "WAREHOUSE",
    "senderId": "[WAREHOUSE_ID_1]",
    "receiverType": "WAREHOUSE", 
    "receiverId": "[WAREHOUSE_ID_2]",
    "items": [
      {
        "itemTypeId": "[ITEM_TYPE_ID]",
        "quantity": 10
      }
    ],
    "transactionDate": "2025-01-28T10:00:00",
    "username": "test_user",
    "batchNumber": 12345,
    "sentFirst": "[WAREHOUSE_ID_1]",
    "description": "Test warehouse to warehouse"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Transaction created successfully using ORIGINAL logic, no changes

### **STEP 4: Test Enhanced Warehouse-Equipment Transactions (NEW)**

**NEW ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY - Warehouse-to-Equipment Transaction:**

```bash
# Test new enhanced warehouse-to-equipment endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/equipment-transactions/warehouse-to-equipment" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_JWT_TOKEN]" \
  -d '{
    "warehouseId": "[WAREHOUSE_ID]",
    "equipmentId": "[EQUIPMENT_ID]",
    "purpose": "CONSUMABLE",
    "description": "Enhanced warehouse to equipment transaction",
    "items": [
      {
        "itemTypeId": "[ITEM_TYPE_ID]",
        "quantity": 5
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Enhanced transaction created with comprehensive tracking

### **STEP 5: Test Enhanced Transaction Processing (NEW)**

**Enhanced Acceptance with Partial Handling:**

```bash
# Test enhanced transaction acceptance
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/equipment-transactions/[TRANSACTION_ID]/accept" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_JWT_TOKEN]" \
  -d '{
    "receivedQuantities": {
      "[TRANSACTION_ITEM_ID]": 3
    },
    "itemsNotReceived": {
      "[TRANSACTION_ITEM_ID]": false
    },
    "comment": "Partial acceptance - received 3 out of 5"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Partial acceptance processed with audit trail

### **STEP 6: Verify Accurate Consumable History (NEW)**

**Test Accurate Stock Calculation:**

```bash
# Test accurate consumable stock calculation
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/equipment-transactions/equipment/[EQUIPMENT_ID]/consumables/[ITEM_TYPE_ID]/current-stock" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_JWT_TOKEN]"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "equipmentId": "[EQUIPMENT_ID]",
  "itemTypeId": "[ITEM_TYPE_ID]",
  "currentStock": 3,
  "isAccurate": true,
  "calculatedAt": "2025-01-28T10:30:00"
}
```

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Accurate stock calculation based on movement history

### **STEP 7: Verify Transaction History Audit Trail (NEW)**

**Test Comprehensive History Tracking:**

```bash
# Test transaction history audit trail
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/equipment-transactions/equipment/[EQUIPMENT_ID]/history" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_JWT_TOKEN]"
```

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Complete audit trail showing all transaction changes
