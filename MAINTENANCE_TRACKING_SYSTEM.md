# External Maintenance Tracking System

## Overview

The External Maintenance Tracking System is a comprehensive solution designed to track the complete lifecycle of equipment/parts from failure identification through repair completion and return to service. The system maintains complete traceability of every handoff, location change, and responsible party throughout the maintenance process.

**Key Integration Features:**

## System Architecture

### Database Design

#### Core Entities

1. **MaintenanceRecord** - Main maintenance record
   - Equipment UUID reference
   - Equipment information (name, model, type, serial)
   - Issue descriptions (initial and final)
   - Status tracking (Active/Completed/On Hold/Cancelled)
   - Cost and duration calculations
   - Current responsible party

2. **MaintenanceStep** - Individual maintenance steps
   - Step type (Transport, Inspection, Repair, Testing, etc.)
   - Responsible person with contact information
   - Location tracking (from/to)
   - Cost and duration for each step
   - Completion status and dates

3. **ContactLog** - Communication tracking
   - Contact method and details
   - Response tracking
   - Follow-up requirements
   - Success/failure metrics

### Equipment Status Management

The system automatically manages equipment status:

- **AVAILABLE** → **IN_MAINTENANCE**: When maintenance record is created
- **IN_MAINTENANCE** → **AVAILABLE**: When maintenance is completed
- **Validation**: Prevents creating maintenance for equipment already in maintenance

## Data Validation Rules

### Maintenance Records
- Equipment ID is required and must reference existing equipment
- Initial issue description is required
- Expected completion date must be in the future
- Current responsible person is required
- Phone numbers must be in valid format
- Equipment cannot be in maintenance if already in maintenance

### Maintenance Steps
- Step type is required
- Description is required
- Responsible person is required
- Start and expected end dates are required
- From and to locations are required
- Step costs must be non-negative

### Contact Logs
- Contact method is required
- Contact person is required
- Contact status is required

## Business Logic

### Status Management
- **Active**: Maintenance in progress
- **Completed**: Equipment returned to service
- **On Hold**: Temporarily suspended
- **Cancelled**: Maintenance cancelled

### Equipment Status Synchronization
- **AVAILABLE** → **IN_MAINTENANCE**: When maintenance record is created
- **IN_MAINTENANCE** → **AVAILABLE**: When maintenance is completed
- **Validation**: Prevents duplicate maintenance records

### Handoff Process
1. Complete current step (set actual end date)
2. Create new step with next responsible person
3. Update main record's current responsible person
4. Transfer custody and accountability

### Cost Calculation
- Total cost = Sum of all step costs
- Automatically calculated when steps are completed
- Supports currency precision (2 decimal places)

### Overdue Detection
- Records: Actual completion date > Expected completion date
- Steps: Actual end date > Expected end date
- Contact follow-ups: Follow-up date < Current date
